Citi CEO Jane Fraser said, “With
net income of $4.1 billion we
delivered a strong quarter,
marked by continued
momentum, positive operating
leverage and improved returns
in each of our five businesses.
Services recorded its best first
quarter revenue in a decade.
Markets had a good first quarter
with revenue up 12% driven by
strong client activity and
monetization. Banking was up
12% with M&A revenue nearly
double from what it was last
year. Wealth revenues increased
24% with progress across all
three client segments. USPB
was up 2%, driven mainly by
growth in Branded Cards, and
also saw improved returns. We
returned $2.8 billion in capital
to our shareholders including
$1.75 billion of buybacks as part
of our $20 billion plan.
“From quarter to quarter, we are
building on our track record of
progress. We remain intently
focused on executing our
strategy, which is based on a
diversified business mix and will
perform in a wide variety of
macro scenarios. When all is
said and done, and longstanding trade imbalances and
other structural shifts are
behind us, the U.S. will still be
the world’s leading economy,
and the dollar will remain the
reserve currency. The deep
knowledge and breadth of
capabilities we bring to the
many markets where we
operate are a point of
distinction as we continue to
help our clients navigate an
uncertain environment,”
Ms. Fraser concluded.

FIRST QUARTER 2025 RESULTS AND KEY METRICS
RETURNED ~$2.8 BILLION IN THE FORM OF COMMON DIVIDENDS AND SHARE
REPURCHASES
PAYOUT RATIO OF 74%(3)
BOOK VALUE PER SHARE OF $103.90

New York, April 15, 2025 – Citigroup Inc. today reported net income for the first
quarter 2025 of $4.1 billion, or $1.96 per diluted share, on revenues of $21.6 billion.
This compares to net income of $3.4 billion, or $1.58 per diluted share, on revenues
of $21.0 billion for the first quarter 2024.

Revenues increased 3%(5)
from the prior-year period, on a reported basis, driven by
growth in each of Citi’s five interconnected businesses, largely offset by a decline in
All Other. Excluding divestiture-related impacts in both periods(6), revenues were
also up 3%.
Net income was $4.1 billion, compared to $3.4 billion in the prior-year period,
driven by lower expenses and the higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of
credit.
Earnings per share of $1.96 increased from $1.58 per diluted share in the prior-year
period, reflecting the higher net income and lower shares outstanding.
Percentage comparisons throughout this press release are calculated for the first
quarter 2025 versus the first quarter 2024, unless otherwise specified.

First Quarter Financial Results
Citigroup
Citigroup revenues of $21.6 billion in the first quarter 2025 increased 3%(5)
, on a reported basis, driven by growth
in each of Citi’s businesses, largely offset by a decline in All Other. Excluding the divestiture-related impacts in
both periods(6), revenues were also up 3%. Net interest income increased 4%, driven by U.S. Personal Banking
(USPB), Markets, Wealth and Services, largely offset by declines in All Other and Banking. Non-interest revenue
increased 1%, driven by Markets, Banking and Wealth, offset by declines in All Other, USPB and Services.
Citigroup operating expenses of $13.4 billion were down 5% on a reported basis, driven by a smaller FDIC special
assessment, the absence of a restructuring charge and lower compensation expenses. The lower compensation
expenses included a favorable FX impact, productivity savings related to Citi’s organizational simplification,
stranded cost reduction and lower severance. These drivers were partially offset by increases in technology and
communications, professional fees related to Transformation, as well as advertising and marketing expenses.
Excluding the FDIC special assessment and divestiture-related impacts in both periods(7), expenses were down
3%.
Citigroup cost of credit of $2.7 billion increased 15%, driven by a higher net build in the allowance for credit losses
(ACL) related to deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook in the current quarter relative to the prior-year
period, and higher net credit losses in the card portfolios in USPB.
Citigroup net income was $4.1 billion in the first quarter 2025, compared to net income of $3.4 billion in the prioryear period, driven by the lower expenses and the higher revenues, partially offset by the higher cost of credit.
Citigroup’s effective tax rate of approximately 25% in the current quarter was largely unchanged from the first
quarter 2024.
Citigroup’s total allowance for credit losses was approximately $22.8 billion at quarter end, compared to $21.8
billion at the end of the prior-year period. Total ACL on loans was approximately $18.7 billion at quarter end, 1Q'25 4Q'24 1Q'24 QoQ% YoY%

compared to $18.3 billion at the end of the prior-year period, with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of 2.70%, down
from 2.75% in the prior-year period. Total non-accrual loans decreased 2% from the prior-year period to $2.7
billion. Corporate non-accrual loans decreased 8% from the prior-year period to $1.4 billion. Consumer nonaccrual loans increased 4% from the prior-year period to $1.3 billion.
Citigroup’s end-of-period loans were $702.1 billion at quarter end, up 4% versus the prior-year period, driven by
higher loans in Services and Markets, and growth in Retail Banking and Branded Cards in USPB, partially offset by
lower loans in Banking.
Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits were approximately $1.3 trillion at quarter end, up 1% versus the prior-year
period, driven by an increase in Services, largely offset by lower deposits in Wealth, All Other and Markets.
Citigroup’s book value per share of $103.90 at quarter end increased 5% versus the prior-year period, and
tangible book value per share of $91.52 at quarter end increased 6% versus the prior-year period. The increases
reflected higher net income, common share repurchases and beneficial net movements in accumulated other
comprehensive income (AOCI), partially offset by the payment of common and preferred dividends. At quarter
end, Citigroup’s preliminary CET1 Capital ratio was 13.4% versus 13.6% at the end of the prior quarter, driven by
the payment of common and preferred dividends as well as common share repurchases, higher risk-weighted
assets and higher deferred tax assets, largely offset by net income and beneficial net movements in AOCI.
Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio for the first quarter 2025 was 5.8%, unchanged from the prior quarter.
During the quarter, Citigroup returned a total of approximately $2.8 billion to common shareholders in the form
of dividends and share repurchases.

Services
Services revenues of $4.9 billion were up 3%(5)
, driven by growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS), which
continued to gain market share. Net interest income increased 5%, driven by higher deposit spreads as well as an
increase in deposit and loan balances. Non-interest revenue declined 4%, driven by a decline in Securities Services
due to the absence of certain episodic fees in the prior-year period, higher revenue share and the impact of FX in
both TTS and Securities Services, partially offset by the benefit of continued strength in underlying fee drivers
across the business, particularly U.S. dollar clearing volume, cross border transaction value and assets under
custody and administration.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $3.6 billion were up 4%, driven by a 5% increase in net interest income,
partially offset by a 2% decrease in non-interest revenue. The increase in net interest income was driven by higher
deposit spreads as well as an increase in deposit and loan balances, partially offset by the impact of FX. The
decrease in non-interest revenue was driven by the impact of higher revenue share and FX, primarily offset by an
increase in cross border transaction value of 5%, an increase in U.S. dollar clearing volume of 8% and an increase
in commercial card spend volume of 2%.
Securities Services revenues of $1.2 billion were unchanged, driven by a 6% decrease in non-interest revenue,
offset by a 7% increase in net interest income, driven by higher deposit balances. The decrease in non-interest
revenue was driven by the absence of certain episodic fees in the prior-year period, along with the impact of FX
and higher revenue share, partially offset by increases in assets under custody and administration.

Citigold revenues of $1.2 billion increased 24%, driven by higher deposit spreads, higher investment fee revenues

a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi’s Wealth platform and other operating outflows, primarily
offset by the deposit impact from client transfers from USPB(11)

Wealth net income was $284 million, compared to $175 million in the prior-year period, driven by the higher
revenues, largely offset by the higher cost of credit.
U.S. Personal Banking (USPB)(12)
USPB revenues of $5.2 billion increased 2%, driven by growth in Branded Cards and Retail Banking, largely
offset by a decline in Retail Services. Net interest income increased 6%, driven by loan growth in Branded Cards
as well as higher deposit spreads in Retail Banking. Non-interest revenue decreased 168%, primarily driven by
higher partner payment accruals in Retail Services.
Branded Cards revenues of $2.9 billion increased 9%, partially driven by interest-earning balance growth of 8%
and higher card spend volume, up 3%.
Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion decreased 11%, primarily driven by higher partner payment accruals.
Retail Banking revenues of $661 million increased 17%, driven by the impact of higher deposit spreads, largely
offset by the deposit impact from the client transfers to Wealth(11)
.
USPB operating expenses of $2.4 billion were unchanged from the prior-year period, driven by continued
productivity savings, offset by higher advertising and marketing as well as legal expenses.
USPB cost of credit was $1.8 billion, compared to $2.2 billion in the prior-year period. The decrease was driven by
a net ACL release in the current quarter, reflecting both a decline in card balances, and also an ACL build related
to changes in portfolio composition and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. This compared to an ACL
build in the prior-year period due to portfolio mix changes. This change in ACL was partially offset by higher net
credit losses in the card portfolios.
USPB net income of $745 million increased 115%, driven by the lower cost of credit and the higher revenues.

All Other (Managed Basis)
(13)
All Other (managed basis) revenues of $1.4 billion decreased 39%, driven by lower net interest income and the
impact of mark-to-market valuation changes on certain investments in Corporate/Other as well as lower revenue
related to wind-down and exit markets and the impact of Mexican peso depreciation.
Legacy Franchises (managed basis)(13)
revenues of $1.6 billion decreased 11%, driven by lower revenue related to
closed exits and wind-downs and the impact of the Mexican peso depreciation.
Corporate/Other revenues of $(176) million decreased from $557 million in the prior-year period, largely driven
by lower net interest income and the impact of mark-to-market valuation changes on certain investments.
All Other (managed basis) expenses of $2.2 billion decreased 17%, driven by a smaller FDIC special assessment
and the absence of a restructuring charge versus the prior-year period, as well as the reduction from wind-down
and exit markets and the impact of the Mexican peso depreciation.
All Other (managed basis) cost of credit was $359 million, compared to $186 million in the prior-year period,
driven by a net ACL build related to deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook in the current quarter, and higher
net credit losses in the consumer loan portfolio in Mexico.
All Other (managed basis) net loss was $(870) million, compared to $(477) million in the prior-year period, driven
by the lower revenues and the higher cost of credit, partially offset by the lower expenses.

(1) Ratios as of March 31, 2025 are preliminary. Citigroup’s allocated average tangible common equity (TCE) and
return on average tangible common equity (RoTCE) are non-GAAP financial measures. RoTCE represents
annualized net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average TCE. For the components
of these calculations, see Appendix A. See Appendix F for a reconciliation of common equity to TCE. For a
reconciliation of the summation of the segments’ and components’ average allocated TCE to Citigroup’s total
average stockholder’s equity, see Appendix H.
(2) Ratios as of March 31, 2025 are preliminary. Commencing January 1, 2025, the capital effects resulting from
adoption of the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) methodology have been fully reflected in Citi's regulatory
capital. For additional information, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Treatment—Modified Transition
of the Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology” in Citigroup’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
For the composition of Citigroup’s CET1 Capital and ratio, see Appendix D. For the composition of Citigroup’s
SLR, see Appendix E.
(3) Citigroup’s payout ratio is the sum of common dividends and common share repurchases divided by net
income available to common shareholders.
(4) Citigroup’s tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Appendix F for a reconciliation
of common equity to tangible common equity and resulting calculation of tangible book value per share.
(5) In the first quarter 2025, Citigroup’s and Services’ reported revenue included $(51) million and $(36) million,
respectively, from the impact of the currency devaluation in Argentina.
(6) Citigroup’s revenues excluding divestiture-related impacts are non-GAAP financial measures. For a
reconciliation to reported results, please refer to Appendices B and C.
(7) Citigroup’s expenses excluding the FDIC special assessment and divestiture-related impacts are non-GAAP
financial measures. For a reconciliation to reported results, please refer to Appendices B and C.
(8) Effective January 1, 2025, certain transaction processing fees paid by Citi, primarily to credit card networks,
reported within USPB, Services, Wealth and All Other - Legacy Franchises, which were previously presented
within Other operating expense, are presented as contra-revenue within Commissions and fees, reported in
non-interest revenue. Prior periods were conformed to reflect this change in presentation.
(9) Prime balances are defined as client’s billable balances where Citigroup provides cash or synthetic prime
brokerage services.
(10) Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the Corporate Lending portfolio that includes
both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gain / (loss) on loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the
credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. In the first quarter
2025, gain / (loss) on loan hedges included $14 million related to Corporate Lending, compared to $(104) million
in the prior-year period. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the Corporate Lending
revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the impact of gain /
(loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation to reported results, please refer to
Appendix G.
(11) Reflects the impact of the net deposit balance transfers from USPB to Citigold in Wealth of approximately $14
billion over the last 12 months, including approximately $4 billion during the first quarter 2025. These amounts
represent the balances at the time client relationships are transferred.
(12) Effective January 1, 2025, USPB changed its reporting for certain installment lending products that were
transferred from Retail Banking to Branded Cards and Retail Services to reflect where these products are
managed. Prior periods were conformed to reflect this change.
(13) All Other (managed basis) reflects results on a managed basis, which excludes divestiture-related impacts, for
all periods, related to Citigroup’s divestitures of its Asia consumer banking businesses and the planned
15
divestiture of its Mexico consumer banking and small business and middle market banking within Legacy
Franchises. Certain of the results of operations of All Other (managed basis) and Legacy Franchises (managed
basis) that exclude divestiture-related impacts are non-GAAP financial measures. For additional information
and a reconciliation of these results, please refer to Appendix C.
