Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, commented: “The Firm reported strong
underlying business and financial results in the first quarter, producing net
income of $14.6 billion.”
Dimon continued: “In the CIB, Investment Banking fees rose 12% in the first
quarter, although clients have become more cautious amid an increase in
market volatility driven by geopolitical and trade-related tensions. Meanwhile,
we saw increased activity in the Markets business. Markets revenue rose to
$9.7 billion, an exceptionally strong quarter with record revenue in Equities. In
CCB, the franchise continued to acquire new customers at a robust pace,
opening 500,000 net new checking accounts and adding record first-time
investors in wealth management. Finally, AWM had healthy AUM net inflows
of $90 billion, and investment performance remained strong.”
Dimon added: “This quarter, we repurchased $7 billion of common stock and
announced a 12% increase in the common dividend. The increase in capital
return was supported by our strong earnings generation and elevated capital
levels. That being said, we continue to believe it is prudent to maintain excess
capital and ample liquidity in this environment – our CET1 ratio remained very
strong at 15.4%, and we have an extraordinary amount of liquidity, with $1.5
trillion of cash and marketable securities.”
Dimon added: “The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including
geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the
potential negatives of tariffs and “trade wars,” ongoing sticky inflation, high
fiscal deficits and still rather high asset prices and volatility. As always, we
hope for the best but prepare the Firm for a wide range of scenarios.”
Dimon concluded: “We remain committed to serving our clients and
communities, which include consumers, small and large-sized businesses,
schools, cities, states and countries, across all environments. And our fortress
balance sheet enables the Firm to be a pillar of strength, particularly during
volatile or challenging times.”

Discussion of Results:
Net income was $14.6 billion, up 9%.
Net revenue was $46.0 billion, up 8%. Net interest income was $23.4 billion, up 1%. Noninterest revenue was $22.6 billion, up
17%.
Net interest income excluding Markets2
 was $22.6 billion, down 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin
compression as well as lower deposit balances in CCB. These were predominantly offset by higher revolving balances in Card
Services, the impact of securities activity including activity in prior quarters, as well as higher wholesale deposit balances.
Noninterest revenue excluding Markets2
 was $13.8 billion, up 20%. Excluding the $588 million First Republic-related gain11
,
noninterest revenue excluding Markets2
 was up 14%, largely driven by higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB, lower
net investment securities losses compared to the prior year and higher investment banking fees. Markets revenue was $9.7
billion, up 21%, primarily driven by higher Equity Markets revenue.
Noninterest expense was $23.6 billion, up 4%, driven by higher compensation, including higher revenue-related compensation
and growth in front office and technology employees. The increase was also driven by higher brokerage expense and
distribution fees, higher marketing expense and the absence of a legal benefit from the prior year. These increases were largely
offset by the impact of a FDIC special assessment accrual release of $323 million compared with an increase of $725 million in
the prior year.
The provision for credit losses was $3.3 billion. Net charge-offs were $2.3 billion, up $376 million, predominantly driven by
Card Services. The net reserve build of $973 million included $549 million in Wholesale and $441 million in Consumer and
was largely driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook. The prior-year provision was $1.9 billion, net
charge-offs were $2.0 billion and the net reserve release was $72 million.

Markets revenue was $5.8 billion, up 8%, predominantly driven by higher revenue in Rates and Commodities. Equity Markets

compensation and growth in employees, as well as higher brokerage expense and higher legal expense, primarily due to the

2. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures:
a. The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an
understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the
Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s
results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis;
these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of
business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP
results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as a whole and for each of the
reportable business segments and Corporate on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments
that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from yearto-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt
items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a
whole or by each of the lines of business and Corporate. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to
managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement.
b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share
(“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total
stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing
rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page
10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as
a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end.
Book value per share was $119.24, $116.07 and $106.81 at March 31, 2025, December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2024,
respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s
use of equity.
c. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also
reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets
revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These
metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the
performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart
from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business
performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net
interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue.
Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue
trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the
Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to pages 81-82 of the Firm’s
2024 Form 10-K.

9. Client deposits and other third party liabilities (“client deposits”) pertain to the Payments and Securities Services
businesses.
10. Assets under management (“AUM”).
11. On January 17, 2025, the Firm reached an agreement with the FDIC with respect to certain outstanding items related to the
First Republic acquisition. As a result of the agreement, the Firm made a payment of $609 million to the FDIC on January
31, 2025 and reduced its additional payable to the FDIC, which resulted in a gain of $588 million which was recorded in
other income in the first quarter of 2025. Refer to Note 34 on pages 319-321 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional
information.

unused amounts of advised uncommitted lines of credit where the Firm has discretion on whether or not to make a loan
under these lines. Credit and capital for corporations and non-U.S. government entities includes Individuals and Individual
Entities primarily consisting of Global Private Bank clients within AWM.
16. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm made a change to its funds transfer pricing with respect to consumer deposits,
resulting in an increase in the funding benefit reflected within CCB net interest income which is fully offset within
Corporate net interest income.
