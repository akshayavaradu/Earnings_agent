    <h2>2. Qualitative Summary</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Loan Portfolio Trends:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Branded Cards (USPB):</strong> Loan balances increased by 6% YoY, driven by higher card spend volume and interest-earning balances. The ACL release in 1Q2025 (-$171M) reduced delinquencies compared to a $246M build in 4Q2024, reflecting improved portfolio management and lower risk exposure.</li>
            <li><strong>Corporate Lending (Banking):</strong> Loans declined by 8% YoY, primarily due to lower loan balances and higher prior-year recoveries. The $185M ACL build in 1Q2025 indicates increased provisioning for macroeconomic risks, despite a 44% QoQ revenue growth from mark-to-market adjustments.</li>
            <li><strong>Services:</strong> Loan growth of 6% YoY was supported by Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) market share gains. A modest $18M ACL build suggests stable credit quality, though non-interest revenue fell 29% QoQ due to FX impacts and revenue-sharing adjustments.</li>
            <li><strong>Markets:</strong> Loans rose 7% YoY, driven by higher trading account assets and client activity. However, net credit losses increased 82% YoY, reflecting heightened risk in spread products, partially offset by a 52% decline in ACL builds compared to 1Q2024.</li>
            <li><strong>Wealth:</strong> Slight 1% YoY loan decline was offset by higher deposit spreads and investment fee revenues. A $60M ACL build in 1Q2025 highlights cautious provisioning amid macroeconomic uncertainty, despite a 24% YoY revenue increase.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Key Drivers:</strong> 
        - <em>Origination</em> growth in Branded Cards and Markets was offset by declines in Banking. 
        - <em>Delinquencies</em> improved in Corporate Lending and Services but worsened in Markets. 
        - <em>Macro factors</em> (e.g., U.S. economic resilience, FX volatility) influenced ACL adjustments and credit losses across segments.
