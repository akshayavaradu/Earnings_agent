    <h2>2. Qualitative Summary</h2>
    <p>
        **Key Strategic Initiatives and Guidances (2025):**
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Capital Returns:</strong> Citi maintained a 74% payout ratio in 1Q2025 ($2.8B returned to shareholders via dividends and buybacks), reflecting confidence in long-term U.S. economic stability and dollar reserve status. Guidance suggests continued prioritization of capital recycling under the $20B plan.</li>
            <li><strong>Margin Optimization:</strong> Operating expenses declined 5% YoY in 1Q2025, driven by cost-cutting in legal, severance, and technology. CEO emphasized "positive operating leverage" as a strategic pillar for 2025 growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Revenue Diversification:</strong> Business segments showed strength in areas like Markets (12% YoY revenue growth) and USPB (2% QoQ revenue increase) amid defensive performance in Wealth (24% YoY growth) and Services (3% YoY growth).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        **Macroeconomic Trends Impacting 2025 Performance:**
        <ul>
            <li><strong>U.S. Economic Resilience:</strong> CEO Fraser underscored the U.S.'s role as the "world's leading economy" and the dollar's purchasing power as long-term strategic advantages, despite near-term trade imbalances.</li>
            <li><strong>Global FX Volatility:</strong> Currency depreciation (e.g., Mexican peso) and higher revenue share impacted segments like Services and Markets, requiring hedging and portfolio repositioning.</li>
            <li><strong>Credit Conditions:</strong> Steeling for macroeconomic stress, Citi increased ACL builds in 1Q2025 ($210M net build) due to deteriorating macro outlook. Credit losses in card portfolios rose 6% YoY, though NPLs decreased 2% YoY via measured loan growth and diversification.</li>
        </ul>
