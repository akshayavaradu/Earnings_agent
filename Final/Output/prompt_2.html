<h2>Qualitative Summary: Key Drivers of 1Q2025 Financial Performance</h2>

<p><strong>Net Interest Income:</strong> The 4% increase in net interest income (from \$4.6B to \$4.8B) was driven by strong contributions from <span class="highlight">USPB</span> (6% growth due to higher deposit spreads and loan growth in Branded Cards) and <span class="highlight">Markets</span> (7% growth from increased client activity and monetization). However, declines in <span class="highlight">Banking</span> and <span class="highlight">All Other</span> segments offset some of this growth. Notably, the overall rise in net interest income reflects Citi's focus on optimizing its business mix and leveraging macroeconomic conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Non-Interest Income:</strong> The 1% increase in non-interest income (from \$17.4B to \$16.8B) was primarily due to gains in <span class="highlight">Markets</span> (12% growth from equity derivatives and higher volatility) and <span class="highlight">Banking</span> (12% from Investment Banking fees and prime services). However, declines in <span class="negative">USPB</span> and <span class="negative">Services</span> significantly impacted this segment. The reduction in non-interest income compared to prior-year performance highlights the challenges faced by certain businesses, including FX headwinds and episodic fee reductions.</p>

<p><strong>Expenses:</strong> Operating expenses fell by 5% (from \$14.1B to \$13.4B) due to a smaller FDIC special assessment, absence of a restructuring charge, and productivity savings. The lower compensation expenses (including favorable FX impacts and cost reductions) were a key driver. However, expenses increased in <span class="negative">technology</span> and <span class="negative">advertising</span> as the bank invested in digital transformation and client engagement. When excluding these factors, expenses declined by 3%, underscoring cost discipline.</p>

<p><strong>Key Context:</strong> Despite a 15% rise in cost of credit (\$2.7B in 1Q2025 vs. \$2.365B in 1Q2024), the combination of revenue growth (3%) and expense reduction (5%) led to a \$700M increase in net income (\$4.1B vs. \$3.4B). Strategic priorities like organizational simplification and focus on fee-based services drove this performance, even as macroeconomic risks (such as ACL build-ups and credit losses in legacy segments) persisted.</p>
