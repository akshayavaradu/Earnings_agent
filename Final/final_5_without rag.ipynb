       "\n",
       "In the first quarter of 2025 (Q1 2025), Citigroup reported a net income of $4.1 billion, marking a significant improvement compared to the Q1 2024 level of $3.4 billion. The company achieved this growth through strategic and operational efficiency improvements across its various business segments.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Net Interest Income\n",
       "\n",
       "Net interest income saw an increase from $21.0 billion in Q1 2024 to $21.8 billion in the same period in 2025, a rise of $863 million or 4% on a dollar basis and by 4 percentage points relative to the prior year. The primary drivers behind this growth were the significant upturns in revenue from U.S. Personal Banking (USPB), Markets, Wealth and Services businesses, which together accounted for approximately two-thirds of the total increase. This growth was counterbalanced only slightly by declines reported in All Other and Banking segments.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Non-Interest Income\n",
       "\n",
       "Non-interest income also increased significantly to $76.1 billion from $75.0 billion in Q1 2024, marking an upsurge of $2.1 million or 1%. Of this increase, the growth contributed by Markets, Banking and Wealth segments accounted for more than half, while a decrease in All Other, USPB, and Services sectors offset some of this growth.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Non-Interest Expense\n",
       "\n",
       "Non-interest expense decreased from $13.4 billion in Q1 2024 to $12.7 billion in Q1 2025, representing a reduction of $769 million or about 5%. This decrease was primarily attributed to the absence of a restructuring charge and lower compensation expenses, coupled with a favorable impact from currency exchange (FX) and productivity savings due to organizational simplification.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, Citigroup's robust performance in Q1 2025 is underpinned by sustained revenue growth across several business units and strategic cost management efforts, particularly in reducing non-interest expense. These factors have collectively contributed to a significant improvement in the company’s financial health and outlook for future quarters."
